# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data to gauge public sentiment. Utilizing the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon within the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, we analyze tweets to determine the general sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in the text.

## Dependencies

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- Regex (re)

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset is preprocessed to make it suitable for sentiment analysis, which involves:

- Cleaning the tweets to remove unnecessary characters and formatting
- Tokenizing the text data
- Removing stopwords to focus on more meaningful words

## Sentiment Analysis Model

We use the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer from NLTK's sentiment module to assign sentiment scores to tweets:

```python
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
```

## Analysis and Visualization

Sentiment scores are visualized to illustrate the distribution of sentiment across the dataset:

- Histograms to show frequency distribution of sentiment scores
- Bar charts to compare the volume of tweets by sentiment category
- Heatmaps to demonstrate correlations, if any, between different sentiment scores

## Results

The analysis results provide insights into the general sentiment on Twitter. This could have practical applications such as:

- Brand monitoring
- Public opinion analysis
- Market research

## Repository Contents

- `Twitter Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis steps from data loading to sentiment analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

To run this analysis, clone the repository, and ensure you have the required dependencies installed. Execute the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project utilizes powerful text analysis techniques to understand and visualize the sentiments expressed in tweets. The insights derived from this analysis could inform business strategies, political campaigns, and social media monitoring.
