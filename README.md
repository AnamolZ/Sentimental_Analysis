# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

Project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in Twitter comments related to specific topics or brands. The analysis process begins by cleaning the dataset, which includes removing punctuation, stopwords, and irrelevant characters. Sentiment is then assessed using the VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer, which categorizes comments into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The dataset is filtered to focus on specific topics, such as Nvidia, and visualizations are generated to depict sentiment distribution. This analysis provides valuable insights into public sentiment regarding a particular brand or topic.

### Key Insights

The results of the sentiment analysis offer actionable insights, which can be applied in various domains:

- **Brand Monitoring**: Track public sentiment towards a brand over time.
- **Public Opinion Analysis**: Gauge general sentiment on trending topics.
- **Market Research**: Support data-driven decision-making for businesses.
